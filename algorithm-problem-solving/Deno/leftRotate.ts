/**
 * 
 * A left rotation operation on an array shifts each of the array's elements  unit to the left. For example, if  left rotations are performed on array , then the array would become . Note that the lowest index item moves to the highest index in a rotation. This is called a circular array.

Given an array  of  integers and a number, , perform  left rotations on the array. Return the updated array to be printed as a single line of space-separated integers.

Function Description

Complete the function rotLeft in the editor below.

rotLeft has the following parameter(s):

int a[n]: the array to rotate
int d: the number of rotations
Returns

int a'[n]: the rotated array
Input Format

The first line contains two space-separated integers  and , the size of  and the number of left rotations.
The second line contains  space-separated integers, each an .

Constraints

Sample Input

5 4
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output

5 1 2 3 4
Explanation

When we perform  left rotations, the array undergoes the following sequence of changes:

/*
 * Complete the 'rotLeft' function below.

 * The function is expected to return an INTEGER_ARRAY.
 * The function accepts following parameters:
 *  1. INTEGER_ARRAY a
 *  2. INTEGER d

function rotLeft(a: number[], d: number): number[] {
    // Write your code here
    let i= 0;
